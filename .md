## Ingredients
| Q | I |
| ---- | ---- |
| 2 1/2 pounds | chuck roast cubed |
| 1/4 cup | olive oil |
| 1 medium | onion diced |
| 3 medium | carrots diced |
| 2 large | celery ribs diced |
| 8 ounces | baby Bella mushrooms sliced |
| 1 cup | dry red wine (Chianti, valpolicella, carbernet, etc) |
| 2 cups | low sodium beef stock |
| salt and pepper | to taste |
| 1 tablespoon | fresh rosemary |
| 1 large | bay leaf |
| 1 tablespoon | cornstarch |
| 1 ounce | water |

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 300f and make room on the middle rack for a large Dutch oven.
2. Heat a large Dutch oven to medium-low heat, then add the olive oil, carrots, celery, and onion. Cook for 5 minutes then add the mushrooms, turn heat to medium, and continue to cook stirring frequently.
3. While the veggies are sauteing, pat the chuck roast cubes dry. Once the mushrooms release their water and most of it has evaporated from the pot, season the beef cubes with salt and pepper and add to the pot.
4. Coat the beef with the veggies and oil. Let the beef cook for 5-10 minutes (it won't develop much color). Next, turn heat to medium-high and add the wine and cook for 5-7 minutes or until it mostly evaporates and absorbs into the beef. Using a wooden spoon scrape up all of the brown bits while the beef is cooking.
5. Add the beef stock, rosemary, and bay leaf and stir it all together. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook in the oven for 2 1/2 hours or until tender.
6. Once the beef is tender, remove the pot from the oven. If there is too much liquid in the pot, use a slurry of cornstarch (see notes) to thicken or cook over medium heat on the stovetop to thicken and reduce the liquid. Once satisfied with the consistency, taste test and make final adjustments to salt and pepper. Serve with crusty bread or with polenta or mashed potatoes.

## Notes
- Leftovers can be saved for up to 3 days in the refrigerator and 3 months in the freezer. Reheat in the microwave or over medium-low heat on the stovetop until hot.
